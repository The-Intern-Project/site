## Live in San Francisco, Mountain View, or Palo Alto.
As far as start-ups go, San Francisco is more artsy/hipster-ish/design-friendly, with a ton of startups mostly in the SOMA district and (from what I can tell) more reasonable working hours than down in MV/PA.  Mountain View and Palo Alto also have a reasonable amount of good food and events going on, but are nowhere near as busy as San Francisco.

If you want a well-rounded summer, San Francisco means that there is a ton to explore around the city without going to the same place twice, from dive bars to fantastic restaurants, to Golden Gate Park to Mission Burritos.  San Francisco is fun.  I lived in Mountain View during my summer at Facebook; some friends bashed MTV as being a dead town, but I don't necessarily agree - Castro Street is a reasonable downtown, and so long as you know other interns/people in tech, you're not going to be bored. Palo Alto is just north of MTV (10 minute caltrain or half an hour on a bike), a bit more upscale/happening, but therefore more expensive.

Your mileage may vary if you live anywhere else - from what I've heard, it's tough to get out to events and there just isn't the critical mass of other interns/people from tech.  I have been especially advised not to live in north San Jose.  There area also areas of SF you don't want to live in - the Tenderloin, anywhere west of Divisadero, parts of SOMA and the Mission. Check out [this amazing map][3] that figures out neighborhoods in SF based on Craigslist postings.

** Where do I found housing/roommates?**
Warning: this process is going to suck. Start early.

*** Finding Housing:

- If your company offers you housing, seriously consider taking it. There's so much less work involved that way.  Even if they don't, ask your recruiter if they have any suggestions/places they know of/ways they can help.
- Find other interns from your school and try to find housing together. Warning: finding housing for more than about 4 people, especially as time draws near, is a challenge.
- Join the [2013 Summer Intern Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/210814239033807/) and add yourself to the [roommate search](https://www.facebook.com/questions/251394174975813/?qa_ref=qd) poll.
- Search on [Craigslist](http://craigslist.org), but probably not directly: instead, use [PadMapper](http://padmapper.com) and [LiveLovely](http://livelovely.com), as well [Airbnb Sublets](https://www.airbnb.com/sublets).
- [This post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/210814239033807/243098055805425/) on the Facebook Intern Group suggests potential sources of Alternate Housing.
- [Chez JJ](http://chezjj.com/) offers what is basically a high-end hostel for techies. Chez JJ and other hacker houses are probably not going to give you your own room, but the community (at least as Chez JJ) is pretty great.
- Make sure to check out the [Walk Score][4] of a place before agreeing to live there and aim for 75 or above.
- Watch out for Craigslist scams. If you can't make it out and check out the place, maybe a friend (or somebody at your company) could do you a favor and meet the future landlord in person.

## How much should I pay?

You're going to pay too much, just be ready.

In San Francisco, if you're willing to share a bedroom or have a small place, or not have a great location, you should be able to find something for $1,200 or so.  If you want something in a better location, or a newer building, or don't want to spend a lot of time searching, be prepared to pay $1,500 to $2,000.  If you find good housing for less than $1,200 a month, you got lucky - take it immediately.

Palo Alto is roughly 20% cheaper than SF, and Mountain View is another 10% cheaper than Palo Alto.  If you don't mind living a bit further away, places like Burlingame, Sunnyvale, etc, are going to be even cheaper -- but at the cost fo a longer commute.  Google Maps is a reasonable way to check your commute length - more than about 30 minutes is not going to be fun.

## Should I live in SF if I work lower south?

San Francisco is a more vibrant, busier place than South Bay.  Every year, a good number of interns decide to live up north and commute every day, either by Caltrain, car, or provided (Apple, Facebook, Google) shuttles.  The question is whether the better location justifies the longer commute.

### Heading to SF for events
It takes an hour and $7 to SF by Caltrain on a weeknight (though the last train back leaves at midnight),

### Opportunity Cost
- Living closer to work would save you about 50 hours of time over the summer.
- [Research](http://healthland.time.com/2012/05/08/long-commute-your-heart-and-waistline-may-suffer-for-it/) shows longer commutes make people fat an unhappy.
- Make sure to figure out if the commute is worthwhile before committing yourself to 100 hours (1 hour * 2 times a day * 5 days a week * 10 weeks) of commuting.

### Rule of Thumb
A good metric for figuring out whether you should bear the cost of an hour-long commute every day is: on average, do you intend to go out on more than one weeknight per week? If so, live in San Francisco.
