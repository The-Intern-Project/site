- Sept 6-8: [PennApps](http://pennapps.com).  Philadelphia, PA.  40 hours.

Reasons to go: Been around for a while (this is v7 of PennApps), it's a giant event (450+ in the Spring, expecting 900 this time), $10k grand prize and travel reimbursements from (really) places as far away as Japan and Switzerland. The student-run hackathon. Plus, nerf guns.  [pennapps.com/apply](http://pennapps.com/apply)

- Sept 20-22: [MHacks](http://facebook.com/MHacksHackathon).  Ann Arbor, MI. 24 hours.

Reasons to go: The contender.  Started in Feb 2013, with 500+ hackers in attendance and aiming for 1,000 this time around.  According to David Fontenot, "The Most Epic Hackathon. Ever."

- Sept 27-29: [UOfTHacks](http://uofthacks.com). Toronto, Canada.  36 hours.

Reasons to go: Starting a hackathon, eh guys? First time event featuring seminars, workshops and a keynote.

- Oct 4-6: [HackMIT](http://www.hackmit.org) Boston, MA.  24 hours.

Reasons to go: Over $5,000 in prizes, plus a chance to beat an MIT on their home turf (or, if you go to MIT, defend your honor).  October is v2, v1 seems to have 200 hackers in February 2013.

- Oct 12-13: [HackRU](http://www.hackru.org) New Brunswick, NJ 24 hours.

Reasons to go: Rutgers CS students are an unbelievably creative bunch. They've been throwing this event since 2011, and they're a solid bunch.

- Nov 8-10: [HackPrinceton](http://hackprinceton.com) Princeton NJ 24 hours.

Reasons to go: Since 2011.  Featuring a dedicated Hardware Hack Track and what is apparently an unbelievable gorges campus.

Not yet scheduled for the fall:
-------------------------------

- [HackNY](http://theinternproject.com/hackathons/): New York, NY. TBA, probably in October/November.

Organized by HackNY, a non-profit by professors from Columbia & NYU dedicated to keeping hackers off the (Wall) Street.  Every semester since 2010, so this would be v8.  Great hacker community and a chance to see New York at 5AM when you throw your hands up and wander around looking for doughnuts.

- …and probably others I haven't heard of.  Let us know at wearetheinternproject@gmail.com
